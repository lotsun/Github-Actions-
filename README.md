# Github-Actions-
GitHub Actions make it easier to automate your projects. You can automate tasks for your repositories, either on a timer or when an event happens, like for example, when somebody pushes a branch or opens a poll request. You can create your own actions or use actions created by the community, which you can find in the GitHub marketplace
