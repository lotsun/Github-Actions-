# Github-Actions-
GitHub Actions make it easier to automate your projects. You can automate tasks for your repositories, either on a timer or when an event happens, like for example, when somebody pushes a branch or opens a pull request. You can create your own actions or use actions created by the community, which you can find in the GitHub marketplace. 
My practical examble here is to build actions Locally and publish them to the github marketplace.
